## Concept
Connecting diners who want to share a home cooked meal. Dinner bell is a community focused social media web application. Users will be able to be both a host and a diner. Our applications main goal is to bring people together through food.

## User Stories

### As the Diner
- [ ] I want to share a meal with locals in my community.
- [ ] I want to able to search for meals based on what i am in the mood for.
- [ ] I want to be able to open a secure line of communication between potential hosts.
- [ ] I want to be able to create a profile page to present potential hosts for myself/mygroup

### As the Host
- [ ] I want to see profiles of interested parties to my event.
- [ ] I want to create a profile that describes my dining experience to my potential diners.
- [ ] I want to create a profile that showcases my unique dishes.
- [ ] I want to organize my events.



## Concerns

- [ ] Monetization- Restaurants are heavily regulated. With that in mind dinner bel is not a monetized on demand service like grubhub, uber, airBNB. It is a social app centered around the home cooked meal.

- [ ] Safety- Mom raised me to not talk to strangers on the internet, and definitely not meet them. Because you will potentially be hosting strangers safety will be a concern. Users need to know how close they are to other users but pinpoint locations should not be given out until parties decide on their own term it's time to meet.

## MVP and Beyond

- [ ] Allow diners to search for hosts in their local areas based criteria, acceptable group size, cuisine, .
